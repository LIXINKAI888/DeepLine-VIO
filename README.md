DeepLine-VIO is a visual-inertial odometry system built for tough environments where traditional features struggle, like low texture or varying light. By combining deep-learned line features with points and IMU data, and filtering out unreliable lines, DeepLine-VIO delivers accurate and robust results even in degraded visual conditions.
